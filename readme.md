# **Falkor Plugin Example**

Example [`@falkor/falkor-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-commander "Visit") plugin to demonstrate framework capabilities, and to serve as boilerplate for personal projects.

## **Usage**

Clone the repository's **master** branch and compile `falkor-plugin-example`:

```
$ git clone --branch master git@github.com:theonethread/falkor-plugin-example.git
$ cd falkor-plugin-example
$ npm install
$ npm run [ debug | release ]
```

> _**NOTE:** The `master` branch holds compatible version with already released packages, while the `develop` branch holds a version currently developed along with latest unreleased sources of packages._

The [`@falkor/falkor-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-commander "Visit") module is an optional dependency of plugins, it is not necessary to install it during development, but as a development feature one can test their work-in-progress projects running it from the root of a directory that is a `@falkor-plugin` under development:

```
$ npm install --no-save "@falkor/falkor-commander"
$ npm start
```

> _**NOTE:** Since `npm` v7 optional dependencies will also be installed when running `npm install`._

> _**NOTE:** To pass arguments to a local installation of `falkor-commander` one has to use the double dash POSIX separator twice (since first occurrence will be consumed by `npm` itself while parsing arguments) to pass extra positional arguments to be treated as buffered answers:_

```
$ npm start -- <options>... <buffered-tasks>... -- <buffered-answers>...
```

### **Configuration**

The [`@falkor/falkor-library`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-library "Visit") looks for shared configurations in the Current Working Directory from where `falkor-commander` was executed (files could be named `.falkorrc`, `.ops.json`, `.ops.jsonc`, `falkor.json`, or `falkor.jsonc` - whichever is found first).

To see all available settings, and example plugin customizations check out the big [`.ops.jsonc`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/develop/.ops.jsonc "Open") file provided as an example.

## **Demonstration**

Have a look at our first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spny53X3I7M "Visit") demonstrating the above workflow:

## **Plugin Requirements**

- Plugins should comply to [`@falkor/falkor-bundler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-bundler "Visit") requirements.
- Valid plugins' default exports should be one single -, or an array of `falkor.Task` instance(s).
- Currently `falkor-commander` searches for plugins under the `@falkor` scope by default (with module resolution similar to Node.js').
  - This can be customized running `falkor-commander` with the `-s` or `--scope` argument.
- Valid plugins' `package.json` must contain the keyword `@falkor-plugin` by default.
  - This can be customized running `falkor-commander` with the `-k` or `--keyword` argument.

## **Further Development**

The project uses the [`@falkor/falkor-bundler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-bundler "Visit") module to compile sources. To clone the repository and compile `falkor-plugin-example` one can use the commands:

```
$ git clone --branch develop git@github.com:theonethread/falkor-plugin-example.git
$ cd falkor-plugin-example
$ npm install
$ npm run [ debug | release ]
```

> _**SEE:** `"scripts"` entry in [`package.json`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/master/package.json "Open") for further reference._

> _**NOTE:** Compiling the `develop` sources might need locally linked `develop` versions of downstream modules:_

> _**SEE:** [`npm-link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link "Visit") for further reference._

### **Linting**

The project uses [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier "Visit") for code formatting and [`cspell`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell "Visit") to avoid general typos in both sources and documentation - it is advised to install these packages as extensions in your IDE to prevent CI errors beforehand. To lint the project run:

```
$ npm run lint
```

> _**SEE:** [`.prettierrc`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/develop/.prettierrc "Open") and [`.cspell.json`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/develop/.cspell.json "Open") for further reference._

- To fix formatting issues run `$ npx prettier --write <path-to-file>`. This will overwrite the file with the default formatting applied locally, so then you can review the changes in `git` and **ensure those did not affect production artifacts**.
- To fix spelling errors run `$ npx cspell lint --wordsOnly --unique --gitignore --exclude .git ** .*` for details, and either make the fixes in the sources listed, add `cspell` favored comments, or extend the project-wide `.cspell.json` accordingly.

### **Versioning and Branching Strategy**

Release sources can be found on the `master` branch, this one always points to the latest tagged release. Previous sources of releases can be found using Git version tags (or browsing GitHub releases). Released packages can be found on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-plugin-example "Visit").

The repository's main branch is `develop` (due to technical reasons), this holds all developments that are already decided to be included in the next release. Usually this branch is ahead of `master` one patch version (but based on upcoming features to include this can become minor, or major), so prepared external links may yet be broken.

The `feature/*` branches usually hold ideas and POC code, these will only be merged into `develop` once their impact measured and quality meets release requirements.

> _The project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org "Visit"), Git tags are prefixed with a `v` character._

### **GitHub Actions**

The workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/develop/.github/workflows "Open").

#### **Continuous Integration**

Automatic builds are achieved via GitHub actions, CI will make nightly builds of the `develop` branch (using Ubuntu image).

### **Security**

The project uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com "Visit") and [Snyk](https://snyk.io "Visit") to ensure standard security.
